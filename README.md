PonyPlayerModels
================
A workshop add-on for Garry's Mod which allows players to play as customizable ponies.

/pony_player_models
------------------
This section contains all the files needed to compile and run the addon itself, with all resources compiled and the addon.json file ready. The bulk of development work is focused in this area.

/modlesrc_pony
-------------
This section contains the model source files and commands for compiling them into mdl's. Sadly the compilations for the primary models have not worked for as long as I have been working on this addon and so editing them has been next to impossible. I have found that one possible fix is to seperate the primary models into slightly thinner individual mdl's but that is development work that will take time and code rewrites and as such may be some time coming. If anyone figures out a way to get these models to compile please file an issue explaining as such (or a pull request if you can fix it).
